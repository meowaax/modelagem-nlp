Not finding guilty diddy on all charges also does this. Also hiding the elite and wealthy is another reason these heinous crimes will continue.
"Diddy, who's guilty as one can be, just skated justice,and there's nothing we can do. Currently the corrupt judicial system that is in place must be repaired before any prosecutions take place, or it's all for naught."
Is this to take our eyes off Diddy since he has been found not guilty as well? And that the Weiner laptop has horrible files about children and that is not being dealt with.? Too many known “evidence” that is being held in a “don’t touch” zone.

"No they don’t. It is not our job. You have to stand by the line you draw. You have made so many positive changes and in such a short time. However, you need to simultaneously arrest those guilty of fraud and corruption. Americans are upset about Diddy and Epstein."

"Carrying cases to court isn't easy, it takes time, it takes money and sometimes the verdict depends on who is more connected and has more money Look at everything diddy did and they still didn't find him guilty on all counts"
"Unfortunately, there is some truth to this. Diddy was guilty as sin of the more serious charges, but the jury only convicted on the lesser, gimme charges. Those who testified him now are nervous about him getting out of prison with the next couple of years, if not sooner."
"Amazing Diddy still in jail, even after all heavy charges not guilty. You know they are just itching to get to him, like the killer in High Anxiety. Oh I can kill him, oh life is good, Cleesh. He got's Obama's legacy. What tangled webs we weave, when first we practice to deceive."

"Good. But Ashleigh, you were wrong about the Diddy case for months. You said he was guilty of racketeering &amp; RICO and last night EVEN AFTER THE jURY SAID NOT GUILTY you doubled down and badgered a juror. Just take the loss &amp; admit you were dumb &amp; didn't understand RICO."

They all protect each other when it's convenient for them and throw each other under the bus 🚌 when it's not. Let's see what Trump is really bout. 👀 Wonder why Diddy's charges were found not guilty (the major ones) 🤔...

Literally the USA Government: Epstein‽ Never heard of him. Diddy? He’s just guilty of having a good time.
"Oh, stfu! Your opinion is completely useless because you ignore facts/evidence &amp; just go with ""Believe all women!"" 🙄 *Wood &amp; Heard are liars. Pitt was accused but not proven guilty of anything. Strange flex bringing in politics. Cosby and Diddy are guilty. SOME WOMEN LIE!"

Seems like Trump is because no men who actually raped a child is being outed or going to jail despite many payoffs to victims and explain if Epstein ain’t have clients why is ms Maxwell in prison ? Ijs if Diddy guilty of man act how not Trump one of the victims worked at Maralago
This just in: Diddy not guilty.

Nah Diddy maybe rich but he isn’t part of the white political elite clubs .... which is why he was tried and found guilty. Don’t try to defend your pedos with whataboutery just because they belong to your tribe and you voted for them. No body voted for Diddy.
"Don’t care, she never spoke up about Diddy because she’s guilty too!"
"Wonder if the Jury was promised something from Diddy in return for a Not Guilty Verdict!! They should be checked up on months down the road to see if mortgages paid off (or big payments made), cars or fat bank accounts, big vacations etc show up!!"
Same as with the Diddy case last time. Now he’s suddenly not guilty. Who’s pulling our noses?
"Yeah, I am tired of waiting. Comey should be in jail for his 8647 stunt. Diddy was guilty AF. Epstein had a list and was K!lled. Yet, we wait. It’s gotten old. There will be no justice. We are on to all of it and we are FURIOUS."
That’s a visitors list that isn’t the blackmail list big difference. Why isn’t anyone screaming about the Diddy lists oh we know why politicians and Hollywood elites are above the law. You really want to know who’s on the list look who left the country that’s who’s guilty.

I’ve been questioning this as well. Seems she’s a political prisoner. She did nothing more than what diddy was found guilty for. Just transporting models to the island. Nothing more nothing less it appears. Waiting for her appeal.
Suspicious about client list. Suspicious about Diddy trial not guilty.

Sure he will just like Epstein and Diddy? This is turning into a joke at this point. He's obviously guilty of crimes against humanity so what's the hold up? Just more grandstanding to appease the masses is what I'm seeing. Lots of barking with no results!
That's what I been saying people acting all crazy for that stupid ass files that won't show us what we already know. It's like the Diddy trial year he's found not guilty by having a smart lawyer however we all know he did those things in his mansion and hotel lol
