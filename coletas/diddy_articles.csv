NBCNEWS,"Sean “Diddy” Combs, the onetime global hip-hop titan whosefederal trialunveiled harrowing testimony accusing him of sexual abuse against women and forced drug-dazed “freak offs,” wasacquitted Wednesdayof racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking but found guilty of lesser charges. The jury’s verdict, delivered on the third day of deliberations, declared Combs, 55, not guilty of one count of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion but guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Later Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian denied Combs' bail request, saying it would be impossible for him to prove he does not pose a danger. The verdict is seen as a win for Combs and his defense team, which did not call a single witness during the seven-week trial. After it was read, his family stood in the background, clapping and cheering. Combs fell to his knees in prayer. As he left the courtroom, he told his family, “Thank you, love you.” Teny Geragos,one of Combs’ attorneys,broke out in tears. His lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, made a fist in triumph as the defense team hugged one another and hugged his family. “It’s a great victory for Sean Combs,"" Agnifilo told reporters outside the courthouse. ""It’s a great victory for the jury system. You saw that the Southern District of New York prosecutors came at him with all that they had.” Agnifilo had asked Subramanian to release Combs from federal detention, where he has been for nearly a year. He also asked for Combs to be released on conditions to his home in Miami, offering a $1 million bond. Combs has been a “model prisoner” who is “in the process of working on himself” and has no plans to flee, Agnifilo said. In his denial, Subramanian cited Combs' attorneys’ own words — “we own the domestic violence"" — and said prosecutors had presented evidence that Combs had ""engaged in years of lifelong violence."" ""He continues to be a danger to others,"" Subramanian said. Subramanian set a sentencing date of Oct. 3. Prosecutors are seeking between four and five years behind bars, the judge said. Combs' family, including his mother and his son Justin Combs, left the courthouse shortly after the verdict. A crowd of supporters swarmed the family’s waiting van, shouting, “Free Puff! Free Puff! Free Puff!” His mother, Janice Combs, later returned to the courthouse, waving to onlookers and fans and blowing kisses. Outside court, Combs' supporters celebrated with baby oil, an apparent reference to supplies witnesses said were provided for ""freak offs."" A woman in a bikini danced as a man drizzled baby oil on her from a nearby ledge. Amid the throngs of onlookers were the influencers who have been chronicling the trial from the courthouse since it began roughly two months ago. Los Angeles-based YouTuber Armon Wiggins, who has more than 285,000 followers, declined to share his thoughts about the verdict itself but acknowledged a victory of a different sort. “We changed the face of media. We changed the face of how news gets out,” Wiggins said. “It was a fight in the beginning, because a lot of times people don’t respect the new media, but I’m one of those people who’s willing to fight with the traditional media because we do numbers.” The trial has drawn nationwide attention. No cameras were allowed in court, so to follow along with what was happening in the courtroom, people turned to traditional media sources, as well as influencers who were at the trial. Wiggins said that since he began covering the trial, he’s gained about 60,000 new followers on YouTube and nabbed several radio and TV appearances, including on TMZ and NewsNation. The partial conviction caps an astonishing moment for Combs, a self-made rapper from New York who rose to the pinnacle of hip-hop culture and became a household name. He once ruled the hip-hop and R&B charts and was a fixture in celebrity circles, propelled by his exuberant personality, lavish lifestyle and business pursuits — including reality television and fashion — as an entrepreneur and brand ambassador. After a three-decade run in the spotlight, allegations by his ex-girlfriend the R&B singer Cassie began his precipitous fall from impresario to convicted criminal. Over the course of the trial, a jury of eight men and four women heard the U.S. government accuse Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, of leveraging hispower, wealth and influenceas the head of a “criminal enterprise” to sexually abuse and exploit women for his own gratification over two decades. His defense pitched to jurors that the case was “badly exaggerated” and that he was on trial simply for a “swingers” lifestyle — one tinged with violent behavior and supplies of drugs and baby oil — that was ultimately consensual. Jurors heard from almost three dozen government witnesses, from former personal assistants to stylists to label artists. Some willingly testifying against Combs, while others were granted immunity in exchange for their testimony. Three women, includingCassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, were central figures in the case. They provided graphic testimony about allegations of sexual assault and violence or threats of blackmail. Combs’lawyers called no witnesses,and Combs himself decided not to testify, as much of the defense’s case was laid out during lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Ventura’s attorney, Doug Wigdor, told reporters outside the courthouse Wednesday that his team would have liked to have seen a conviction on the sex crimes and racketeering charges but that they were pleased he has “finally been held accountable” and faces substantial jail time on the lesser charges. On the racketeering conspiracy charge, a jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant was involved in an enterprise among two or more people to engage in at least two criminal acts affecting interstate commerce — offenses that may include kidnapping, arson, bribery, forced labor, sex trafficking and other underlying crimes. For the standalone sex trafficking charge, prosecutors must demonstrate the defendant by force or threat compelled others to commit commercial sex acts in which something of value, such as money, was received. During her nearly five-hour closing argument, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik reminded the jury about various government witnesses who testified about the allegations. She said an ex-assistant of Combs’,Capricorn Clark, was subjected to kidnapping and forced labor, while the car of a romantic rival of Combs,the rapper Kid Cudi, was firebombed in an act of arson. A former assistant who testified under thepseudonym “Mia”and accused Combs of sexually assaulting her multiple times was another example of forced labor, Slavik said. On the two sex trafficking counts, Slavik told jurors that they did not need to believe Ventura or another ex-girlfriend, who testified under the pseudonym “Jane,” were engaged in sex acts against their will in every instance. The women testified about ""freak offs"" and “hotel nights,” which were the names for drug-induced sexual encounters with male escorts they said Combs routinely manipulated them into under threat of releasing recorded videos of the explicit sex acts. “So, if there was one time, one single freak off, when the defendant knew or recklessly disregarded that Cassie or Jane was participating because of his lies, his threats or his violence, then that’s it,” Slavik said, “he’s guilty.” Combs’ defense team maintained that he operated a legitimate business and was being unfairly targeted by overzealous prosecutors. “Sean Combs has become something that is very, very hard to become, very hard to be,” Agnifilo said in his four-hour closing arguments. “He is a self-made successful Black entrepreneur.” While Agnifilo didn’t deny that Combs was consumed by bouts of jealousy and that he engaged in angry tirades that involved domestic violence, the women, ultimately, chose to stay with him, while those in his inner circle had the agency to leave, he said. “If racketeering conspiracy had an opposite, it would be their relationship,” Agnifilo said of Combs and Ventura, who dated on and off from about 2007 to 2018. One key piece of evidence played for the jury repeatedly and frame by frame was security video showing Combs physically assaulting Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016.She testifiedthat he was angered because she was trying to leave a freak off. “We own the domestic violence. We own it. I hope you guys know this,” Agnifilo told the jury while denying Combs was a mastermind who conspired with his employees to commit crimes. No matter the outcome of the criminal case, Combs must contend with aslew of lawsuitsthat have included accusations of rape and sexual assault.Combs, who has denied such allegations, has accused various plaintiffs of pursuing quick “paydays.” Adam Reiss is a reporter and producer for NBC and MSNBC.

ABC,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs reacts to being convicted of prostitution-related offences but acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges.(AP: Elizabeth Williams) In the hours after the jury handed down its verdict in Sean ""Diddy"" Combs's federal court case, a video began to circulate online. It shows a group gathered outside the Manhattan courthouse. Some throw their hands up, others dance, and one squirts a bottle of baby oil on another. They appear to be celebrating Combs — who at the end of 2024 was indicted on US federal charges following a slew of civil lawsuits — being found not guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking, greatly reducing his potential jail time. On July 4, after weeks of trial testimony, including an emotional statement from a heavily pregnantCassie Ventura— who settled a civil suit against her former partner Combs last year — a jury delivered its finding. The 55-year-old was guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, his least serious charges. Combs was found not guilty on two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and on one count of racketeering conspiracy. He will be sentenced in October. For the fans that gathered outside of the courthouse, it was as good as a victory. Some yelled ""free Diddy"" as othersrushed to supply the abundant news cameraswith sound bites claiming all the charges against Combs should have been struck off. The response from fans shows a path forward for the celebrity despite him being convicted of a serious crime. There's something unique about being more than just a casual fan of an artist, according to Bertha Chin, an expert in fandom subculture and a senior lecturer in media and cultural studies at Singapore National University. A strong sense of what feels like a reciprocal connection with a celebrity — otherwise known as a parasocial relationship — can lead to fans being not only engaged with an artist's work, but also ""involved in the politics"", she told ABC Entertainment. In recent years, parasocial relationships have become increasingly prevalent — in part because celebrities are nurturing them. One of Sean Combs's supporters outside the courthouse during his federal trial in May.(Reuters: David 'Dee' Delgado) ""We're saturated with choices, so it's all the more important for artists and celebrities to develop a relationship with their fans. It's a mutually beneficial relationship,"" Dr Chin said. ""Artists are promoting their latest projects or themselves, whereas fans inherently see themselves being represented by the artists, or want to achieve something towards emulating said artists."" And in that relationship, there can be a blurry line between a fan defending an artist and willingly ignoring an artist's bad, or illegal, behaviour altogether. ""There's been a lot of discussions … on whether fans should separate the creator from the art, that continuing to support the media does not necessarily mean that they are also supporting the actions of its creators,"" Dr Chin said. ""It's a complex emotion, and I'd say some fans are more successful at separating the creator from the creative works than others."" Fans sticking by their favourite artists even after they have been convicted of a violent crime is not unheard of. A day before Combs's verdict was handed down, thousands of music fans were lining up outside Glasgow's 50,000-plus capacity Hampden Park stadium to see Chris Brown live in concert. Chris Brown walks outside Southwark Crown Court in London, where he was charged with grievous bodily harm following a 2023 incident.(Reuters: Isabel Infantes) After a string of mid-2000s hit songs, Brown was charged with attacking his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. He pleaded guilty to felony assault over the incident, accepting a plea deal that gained him five years of probation, community service and domestic violence training. Brown has facednumerous legalissues inthe years since his 2009 conviction,including an assault charge this past May. He also caused controversy in June when he posed with his hands around theneck of a female fan during a meet-and-greet. When local news outlet STV questioned the anticipatory fans waiting outside Hampden Park, some said they had no knowledge of the incident at all, some said he had changed, and one woman said she loves a ""bad boy"". ""Both Sean Combs and Chris Brown exert a very particular kind of hyper-masculine trait that attracts a very specific type of fan,"" Dr Chin said. ""Certain artists will attract a specific kind of following based on their image or branding … It's not really about the parasocial relationships as such, but more what fans see and understand an artist represents."" Following his trial, Combs was denied bail, which means he will stay behind bars at least until his sentencing in October. After his sentence is handed down, Combs will have the option to appeal against his conviction or the sentence. Outside of the federal case, Combs is still facing 66 civil lawsuits that accuse him of sexual assault, false imprisonment, battery andmore. A relieved Sean Combs claps his hands in court and tells his family he will be home soon, but the matter is not over yet. Speaking to theAssociated Press, Evan Nierman, CEO and president of crisis public relations firm Red Banyan, said he saw a path for Combs to emerge relatively unscathed, despite all of the accusations. ""This is a very positive outcome overall for him. And it does give him an opportunity to try to rebuild his life,"" Mr Nierman said. ""It won't be the same, but at least he's likely going to be out there in the world and able to move forward."" While each of Combs's convicted charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years, the prosecution has pointed tosentencing guidelinesthat appear to recommend a prison term of a little more than five years. Combs's lawyers say the sentence should be a maximum of two years, with time served on account of music star being behind bars for more than a year. ""It's a powerful thing for the hip hop mogul to go public …that the feds tried to come after him and they failed,"" Mr Nierman said. ""I could definitely see him leaning into that.""

CBSNEWS,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was found guilty Wednesday of transportation to engage in prostitution in his federal trial in New York City, but the music mogul was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. Combs willremain in detention while he awaits his sentencing. Judge Arun Subramanian said later Wednesday he denied bail because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3. Combs was convicted of two counts of the prostitution-related charge. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Prosecutors said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or asentenceof roughly four to five years. As the jury foreperson announced not guilty on the racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charge involving Combs' former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura — the R&B singer known as Cassie — Combs put his hand to his face, his fingers resting on his temples. When he heard the word ""guilty"" for Count 3, the first prostitution-related charge, he was startled. But then ""not guilty"" came for the second sex trafficking count involving another former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym ""Jane."" Combs held hands with attorney Teny Geragos and leaned in to talk to her. Combs looked at his family and made prayer hands. He nodded as each juror affirmed the verdict, shaking his fists triumphantly under the table. He made prayer hands to the jury, hugged Geragos and smiled. He mouthed ""thank you"" to attorney Marc Agnifilo. Combs turned to his family, clasped his hands together and appeared to say: ""I'm coming home."" He looked toward the reporters in the courtroom and again shook his fist under the table. Combs leaned forward and nodded in agreement at the jury as the judge thanked them. He then put his face in his hands and smiled. Combs made prayer hands and mouthed ""thank you"" to the jurors a number of times. Then he clasped his hands and kept thanking them. He leaned back and tilted his head up, again putting his face in his hands as though in disbelief. Combskneeled down on the ground, put his hands on his chair and prayed. He and his family erupted in loud applause, cheering loudly and whistling. Following the decision, Combs' lawyers argued for him to be released from custody immediately and be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. Prosecutors opposed the defense's request and urged Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Combs detained until his sentencing. Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no. The judge asked both the prosecution and defense to submit letters as to why Combs should be released Wednesday or remain detained. Combs' attorneys proposed in their letter that a million-dollar bond be posted for him and that his travel be restricted to parts of Florida, California, New York and New Jersey. New Jersey and New York were included to accommodate Combs traveling to attend court and meet with his attorneys. Combs' attorneys also proposed surrendering his passport and undergoing drug testing when required by the court. Prosecutors proposed that Combs continued to be detained and his bail application be denied. The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning. Jurorsbegan deliberatingin U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'dreached a partial verdictTuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count. The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following hisarrestat a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filedadditional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five. Combspleaded not guiltyto all the charges. The charges against Combs and each verdict were: The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution. Before jurors began their deliberations, Subramanian gave them instructions on how to apply the law to the facts presented during the trial. Jurors were told that, in order to find Combs guilty of the prostitution-related charges, prosecutors must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly transported an individual in ""interstate or foreign commerce"" and intended that the individual ""engage in an act of prostitution."" Subramanian noted that it wasn't necessary for prosecutors to prove that engaging in prostitution was Combs' sole purpose in transporting a person across a state line or foreign border. However, prosecutors needed to prove that a ""significant or motivating purpose"" of the trip was prostitution. The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor. Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case. Combs denied the accusations butchose not to take the standto testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The high-profile trial, whichstarted in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends. Ventura, who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as ""freak-offs."" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy. Ventura testifiedthat Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was ""frequent."" Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. Duringcross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, ""I'm always ready to freak off."" Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught onsurveillance videoshowing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was ""inexcusable"" and that he took ""full responsibility"" for his actions. Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a ""freak-off"" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe. Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quicklyreached a settlementwith her. In hisclosing argumentto the jury Friday, Agnifilo said, ""If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie."" Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym ""Jane"" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called ""hotel nights,"" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the ""hotel nights."" Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up ""hotel nights."" Jane said shefelt pressuredand that she had grown financially dependent on Combs. In theprosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as ""the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise."" She said he used a ""small army"" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. ""He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,"" Slavik said. Agnifilocountered by arguingthat prosecutors ""badly exaggerated"" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy. ""He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,"" Combs' lawyer said. Jericka DuncanandThe Associated Presscontributed to this report.

CNN,"Sean “Diddy” Combs was denied bail on Wednesday after the jury in his federal sex trafficking trial returned its verdict, convicting him on two lesser charges of transportation to engage in prostitution but clearing the hip-hop mogul of the most serious charges. The verdict is, to some extent, a win for Combs, who will avoid the worst case scenario: If he had been convicted of the more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy or sex trafficking, Combs could have faced up to life in prison. Instead, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years – though could serve a shorter sentence. “It’s a bit of a paradox, because here we have Sean Combs, who has just been convicted of two federal felonies,” said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig. “And for all practical purposes, he has won. He has defeated the Southern District of New York.” Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs acquitted of most serious counts Prosecutors accused Combs of leading a criminal enterprise made up of some of his closest employees, alleging they used threats, violence, forced labor, bribery and other crimes to force Casandra “Cassie” Ventura and another woman, “Jane,” to engage in drug-fueled sex acts with male escorts called “Freak Offs” or “hotel nights.” Combs pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation for prostitution. His lawyers argued the sex acts were consensual and merely preferences, while trying to undermine the hip-hop mogul’s accusers by contending they were trying to gain a monetary benefit from Combs. Here are takeaways from the jury’s verdict. Combs and his defense team surely hoped he would be acquitted on all counts. But the verdict Wednesday is something of a boon for a star defendant who hasseen his reputation diminishin the face of repeated accusations of wrongdoing. His acquittals on racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking are striking when looked at within the context of the defendant’s fall from grace: Two years ago, Ventura filed a lawsuit claiming Combs had raped and physically and emotionally abused her. Combs agreed to settle the lawsuit a day later; his attorney said it was “in no way an admission of wrongdoing.” Ventura’s lawsuit was only the beginning: More accusers came forward with allegations against Combs, and in March 2024, heavily armed federal agents searched the producer’s homes in Los Angeles and Florida. Two months later, CNN published hotel surveillance video captured eight years earlier showing Combs physicallyassaulting Ventura in an elevator lobby at a Los Angeles hotel – footage included as part of the prosecution’s case for sex trafficking as to Ventura. Now, while the verdict is mixed, Combs can claim some vindication on being cleared of the most serious charges. “Regardless of what anyone thinks of Sean Combs … the simple fact is, as of right now, in the eyes of the law, he has not been convicted of a crime of violence,” said CNN Legal Analyst Elliot Williams. “He has not been convicted of the far more serious, life-eligible crimes that he was charged with.” The verdict shows prosecutors failed to prove racketeering conspiracy; and while the jury’s reasoning is not known, experts told CNN prior to deliberations thatprosecutors’ greatest challengewould be securing a conviction on this charge. That jurors found Combs not guilty shows they were unconvinced, either of the existence of a so-called “enterprise” – a key piece of any racketeering case – or that he and others committed the underlying crimes that would support a conviction. The charge comes from the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, which was passed by Congress in 1970 to prosecute organized crime. Racketeering is not a single, specific crime, but a framework for prosecuting many different crimes; in a RICO case, these are called “predicate acts.” The Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs case brings to mind another criminal case against a famous musician In Combs’ case, prosecutors specifically argued the defendant and members of his inner circle had engaged in crimes involving kidnapping, arson, forced labor, bribery and sex trafficking. To convict, jurors would have needed to find Combs and at least one other person committed at least two predicate acts within a ten-year window. The use of RICO in Combs’ case, while not entirely novel, was unusual in that he was charged alone. Jurors did not hear direct testimony from many of the people who would have been members of the alleged enterprise – namely his closest employees, like his chief of staff or some of his security guards. And legal analysts had wondered whether the evidence presented at trial had clearly linked Combs’ alleged criminal acts to an enterprise. In their closing argument, the government offered jurors a roadmap, outlining the charge, the elements needed to prove it and the parts of their case that would support a conviction. Still, the argument did not persuade jurors. Combs’ acquittal on sex trafficking charges is a big blow to the prosecutors for the Southern District of New York – and to his accusers, Ventura and a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane,” each of whom spent days testifying, recounting years of abuse they said they suffered from Combs. While prosecutors accused Combs of sex trafficking as a predicate act under the umbrella of racketeering conspiracy, they also charged him with two separate counts of sex trafficking, one each for Ventura and Jane. To prove sex trafficking, prosecutors needed to prove Combs compelled the women to participate in commercial sex acts through force, fraud or coercion. And jurors were presented with myriad examples of alleged physical violence and financial control. Regarding Ventura, prosecutors contended physical force was illustrated in one instance by the InterContinental Hotel surveillance footage showing Combs assault Ventura in 2016 – first published by CNN. Testimony by both women suggested some level of financial or professional control; Ventura signed to Combs’ record label at just 19, and prosecutors agued he controlled her career. Jane, meanwhile, testified she and Combs entered into a “love contract” where he agreed to pay her $10,000 rent, but that he threatened to cut her off financially if she stopped participating in “hotel nights.” Combs’ attorneys had acknowledged physical abuse, but argued throughout the trial that domestic violence did not amount to sex trafficking. Prosecutors also told the jury they weren’t suggesting every “Freak Off” and “hotel night” were instances of sex trafficking. Both Ventura and Jane testified they were willing to try the sexual encounters in the beginning of their relationships with Combs. The jury’s verdict suggests prosecutors did not prove the elements needed to convict – like the force, fraud and coercion. “My heart in this moment is going out to Cassie,” said Dream Hampton, the executive producer of “Surviving R. Kelly.” “I can’t imagine what she’s feeling.” “I’m afraid that with Puff walking from the more serious charges that he’s – not only him, the whole entire discourse – I just wonder what we’re going to learn from this,” Hampton added. Combs was convicted, however, on two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution, each of which pertained to Ventura or Jane and the men Combs paid to have sex with them. Those charges were more straightforward than the other, and prosecutors merely needed to prove that people crossed state lines to engage in prostitution. Both women testified to having “Freak Offs” or “hotel nights” in a variety of locales, and prosecutors presented documents to bolster that testimony, including flight records, American Express charges and hotel invoices for Combs’ former girlfriends and the men. “What was clearer throughout this trial was acts of prostitution that were supported by airplane records, payments and so on – information that would just be hard to deny,” said Williams. “There were sex acts, no one disputes that, and they were paid for. And there’s a paper trail linking the defendant to them. That was far more straightforward for the prosecution to prove compared to some of the other things.” Prior to trial, Combs’ defense unsuccessfully lobbied for the transportation to engage in prostitution charges,which stem from the Mann Act, to be dismissed, citing the statute’s “racist origins.” Attorneys for Combs have previously accused the government of racism, allegations the government denied. Doug Wigdor, Ventura’s attorney, acknowledged Wednesday’s verdict was “not the exact outcome we wanted’ in an interview with CNN. “Cassie prompted this investigation…and now Sean Combs stands before the court as a convicted felon of two federal crimes. He faces significant incarceration,” he said. While the verdict marks the beginning of the end of one legal chapter for Combs, he still faces legal trouble. Most immediately, he’ll face sentencing for the prostitution charges for which he was convicted Wednesday. Each carries up to ten years, but CNN legal analysts indicated it’s possible he serves less. “Certainly very few people are ever sentenced to the top of the statutory maximum,” Williams said. “So we should get the ten year or 20 year figure out of our heads. But he will go to jail for some time.” Sentencing will be scheduled at a later date. Judge Arun Subramanian said in court Wednesday he denied Combs’ bail when it wasn’t mandatory before the trial and “sees no reason to reach the opposite conclusion now.” The judge quoted the defense at different instances when Combs’ lawyers acknowledged his violence toward his former girlfriends. “At trial, the defense conceded defendant’s violence in personal relationships saying ‘it happened’ in relation to Cassie Ventura and Jane,” Subramanian said. Subramanian said there was also violence and illegal conduct after the searches on Combs’ homes, when he was aware he was under investigation. “This highlights a disregard for the rule of law and a propensity of violence,” he said. Prosecutor Maurene Comey said the judge is correct in his decision to keep Combs in detention, saying the music mogul is “an extremely violent man with an extraordinarily dangerous temper who has shown no remorse and no regret for his multiple victims.” Subramanian had asked the defense attorneys and prosecutors to submit letters on their positions about the possibility of releasing Combs ahead of the bail hearing. “Mr. Combs has been given his life by this jury,” defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said in court earlier Wednesday, as he argued for the judge to allow his client to return home. Prosecutors in their letter to the judge said Combs faces a minimum range of 51 to 63 months in prison, according to their preliminary calculation, but it may be higher at sentencing. “The possibility of a substantial sentence such as this is a significant factor in assessing the risk of flight,” the letter says. Earlier, an attorney for central witness Ventura had requested the court keep Combs detained until he is sentenced on the transportation to engage in prostitution charges. “Ms. Ventura believes that Mr. Combs is likely to pose a danger to the victims who testified in this case, including herself, as well as to the community,” Ventura’s attorney Wigdor wrote in a letter. At the bail hearing, Agnifilo said the jury has acquitted Combs of the most serious charges and that Combs has been a model prisoner since he was detained and has done everything his lawyers asked of him. “He came here, he faced the court, he’s been decent with the court each and every day, and he just deserves the chance,” Agnifilo said. Teny Geragos, another one of Combs’ attorneys, made comments outside the New York courthouse, thanking the jury for “putting such great care into this case.” “I also have been saying this since the beginning of this case: Sean Combs has not sexually assaulted anybody. I’ve been saying this for months,” Geragos said. “We’ve said it with each lawsuit that came out and today that was proven true.” The attorney added: “He has not sexually assaulted anybody, certainly hasn’t sex trafficked anybody and the jury found that today.” Combs still faces araft of civil lawsuits– nearly 70 have been filed so far, with several as recent as last week – accusing Combs of further wrongdoing, including sexual assault. Combs has denied all the allegations. Notably, civil claims carry a lower burden of proof. In the criminal trial, jurors needed to find Combs guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But in a civil case, the proof only needs to meet what’s called a “preponderance of the evidence,” or more likely than not. This story has been updated with additional developments. Correction:A previous version of this story had the wrong date for when Sean “Diddy” Combs was denied bail. It was on Wednesday."
BBC,"The trial of American music mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, who was accused of running a sprawling sex trafficking operation, has ended with two guilty verdicts and an acquittal on three others. The rapper was convicted on two counts of transportation for prostitution of his ex-girlfriend, singer Cassie Ventura, and another woman known as ""Jane"" who had testified in the trial. He was found not guilty of the most serious charge of racketeering conspiracy, as well as two charges of sex trafficking in relation to Ms Ventura and ""Jane"". Combs, 55, had pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations against him. Here is a breakdown of the charges faced by the rapper and how the jury came to its decision. Racketeering conspiracy, or directing an illegal enterprise under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico), is the formal name for the charge. The law was created to take on mob bosses, but it has since been used in other trials, including for sex trafficking - such as in the case against disgraced R&B singer R Kelly. It is also sometimes used against a group of defendants. US President Donald Trump and his allies were accused of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia - charges that Trump denied. To convict Combs on this charge, prosecutors had to prove that he used his loyal network of associates to run a criminal enterprise to commit crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, drugging and obstruction of justice. In this case, that network would include his employees, who prosecutors argued played a part in setting up the ""freak-offs"" at the centre of the case. These were prolonged sexual encounters at which the prosecution's key witnesses said they were coerced to have sex with male escorts while Combs watched. In a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in freak-offs, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil. Combs' acquittal on the most serious charge of racketeering will likely be seen as a big win by his legal team. His lawyers had sought to undermine the allegation by asking witnesses whether Combs' employees ever witnessed the freak-offs. Cassie Ventura, the star witness for the prosecution, said she did not think they were present. Defence lawyers argued that the case cannot be considered to be racketeering if members of Combs' staff were not knowingly complicit. ""Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?"" said defence attorney Marc Agnifilo. ""Did any witness get on that witness stand and say 'yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise, I engaged in racketeering'?"" Robert Mintz, a criminal defence lawyer and former federal prosecutor, told the BBC that the racketeering charge was always going to be the most challenging one for prosecutors to prove to a jury. To gain a conviction, lawyers needed to prove that Combs established a co-ordinated plan between himself and at least one other person to commit at least two crimes over a span of several years, Mr Mintz said. ""It's a very complicated charge, used typically in the past in organized crime prosecution,"" Mr Mintz said, adding it is unsurprising that this charge gave the jury the most difficulty. Combs was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution relating to Ms Ventura and an anonymous victim known as ""Jane"". In simple terms, it means the jury found Combs guilty of transporting the two women to places where they would participate in sex acts and prostitution. The felony dates back to the Mann Act, which was enacted in 1910. The Mann Act is a US federal law that was passed to combat human trafficking and sexual exploitation of women. Initially referred to as the ""White-Slave Traffic Act"", the more than 100-year-old law prohibits the transportation of individuals across state lines for illegal sex acts or prostitution. Both Ms Ventura and ""Jane"", who had dated the rapper, separately testified about ""freak-offs"" or ""hotel nights"". They described these as sexual encounters in which the couple would hire male escorts to have sex with the female partner while Combs watched, at times recording or directing them. In its early days, the Mann Act was used by federal prosecutors as a way to criminalise some forms of consensual activity, including interracial relationships. Combs' lawyers referenced that history in an unsuccessful attempt to get one of the charges against the rapper dismissed, arguing that he was being unfairly persecuted because of his race. Transportation for purposes of prostitution - the charge that Combs was convicted of - carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. And Combs was convicted on two counts. After the verdict, his lawyer Marc Agnifilo immediately asked for his client to be released from federal detention until his sentencing hearing, and suggested a $1m bail. But a judge denied that request and said the hip-hop mogul will remain in jail until he is sentenced. Prosecutor Maurene Comey has said she will push for the full 20 years - a decade for each conviction. ""It is clear that the defendant does pose a danger,"" she said. Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024. Critics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence. His lawyers argued for his release in 2024, citing the jail’s “horrific” conditions, but a New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Combs as a “serious flight risk”. Judge Arun Subramanian proposed 3 October as a sentencing date for Combs, but the defence asked for an expedited schedule. The lawyers will meet again on 8 July to further discuss the schedule. The judge said Combs would get 10 months credit for time served. While the rapper faces a maximum sentence of 10 years on each count, it will be up to the judge to decide the length of time he will ultimately serve. Separately, Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault. Tony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US had either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or intended to do so. In December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was ""gang raped"" by Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given ""copious amounts of drugs and alcohol"" before the attack. Combs's legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as ""clear attempts to garner publicity"". Combs' current legal issues began in late 2023 when he was sued by Ms Ventura, also known as Cassie, for violent abuse and rape. That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Combs maintaining his innocence. Since then, dozens of other people have filed lawsuits accusing Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all the claims. His controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CNN published leaked CCTV footage from 2016 showing Combs kicking his ex-girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor. He apologised for his behaviour, saying: ""I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now."" Dozens of potential jurors were vetted by the court. The process included potential jurors looking through a long list of places and people that could be mentioned during trial, with names like Kanye West and Kid Cudi. Potential jurors also had to fill out questionnaires that asked whether they had ""views about hip hop artists"" or ""feelings concerning violence, sexual assault"". The judge reminded the court several times of the importance of choosing a fair and impartial jury. Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged in the hip-hop scene in the 1990s. His early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or The Notorious B.I.G. His music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez. Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand Cîroc. In 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.

LATIMES,"Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs was found guilty Wednesday of transportation for prostitution but cleared of the most serious charges — racketeering and sex trafficking — following a weeks-long federal criminal trial in New York. Before his fate was announced, Combs sat surrounded by his legal team reading a printout of Psalm 11, a Bible passage that emphasizes relying on God for protection, even amid adversity. As the jury of eight men and four women delivered its verdict, Combs, who had appeared morose a day earlier facing the possibility of a life sentence, was exultant. He pumped his fist in the air and mouthed “thank you” to the jurors. He fell to his knees and placed his head on his chair as if in prayer. “Mr. Combs has been given his life by this jury,” defense attorney Marc Agnifilo told Judge Arun Subramanian. The verdict is at least a partial victory for the celebrity, with legal experts arguing that prosecutors made critical errors in overcharging him and failing to prove their case. “Today’s verdict is nothing less than a complete and total failure by the prosecution in what will go down as the most expensive prostitution trial in American history,” said Neama Rahami, a former federal prosecutor. The jury’s split decision leaves Combs facing up to 10 years in prison for each of the two counts of prostitution. But it’s not clear how severe Combs’ punishment will be. In a letter seeking to keep him behind bars, prosecutors listed sentencing guidelines ranging from 51 to 63 months, or just over five years, and the judge has significant leeway in deciding his sentence. In a late afternoon hearing, Subramanian decided that Combs will remain jailed until his sentencing hearing, citing past violent incidents that his attorneys acknowledged during the trial. The scene inside the Manhattan courtroom on Wednesday capped a legal drama that generated global attention and offered a graphic and often violent glimpse into the life of one of the nation’s most powerful music figures and his near billion-dollar enterprise. During the trial, jurors heard from three women, two former girlfriends and a personal assistant, who described a culture within the empire that prosecutors likened to a mob-style racketeering operation. In charging Combs with racketeering, the government alleged his company, Bad Boy Entertainment, functioned as a criminal enterprise that threatened and abused women and used members to engage in a litany of crimes including kidnapping, sex trafficking, bribery, arson, forced labor and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors portrayed Combs and his associates as luring female victims, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship. Once he had gained their interest, prosecutors said Combs used force, threats of force, coercion and drugs to get them to engage in sex acts with male prostitutes while he occasionally watched in gatherings that Combs referred to as “freak-offs.” On the stand, witnesses testified that Combs gave the women ketamine, ecstasy and GHB to “keep them obedient and compliant” during the performances. “Sex crimes deeply scar victims, and the disturbing reality is that sex crimes are all too present in many aspects of our society. Victims endure gut-wrenching physical and mental abuse, leading to lasting trauma. New Yorkers and all Americans want this scourge stopped and perpetrators brought to justice,” Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement after the verdict. The verdict was a bitter disappointment for victim advocates, said Lauren Hersh, the former chief of the sex trafficking unit at the Kings County district attorney’s office in Brooklyn and now the national director of the activist groupWorld Without Exploitation. After successful prosecutions of figures like R. Kelly and cult leader Keith Raniere, some experts saw progress in broadening the popular understanding of how sex trafficking operated and how victims might respond to it. After this verdict, though, “this will 100% cast a chilling effect on prosecutors, who will be reluctant to bring similar charges even when the evidence is overwhelming,” Hersh said. “It’s a huge setback, especially in this moment when the powerful have continuously operated with impunity,” Hersh said. In the wake of multiple lawsuits filed against him, former members of Combs’ inner circle told The Times that his alleged misconduct against women goes back decades. The government’s case relied heavily on three key witnesses: Combs’ onetime lover, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, whose 2023 civil lawsuit began the unraveling of Combs’ empire; his most recent ex-girfriend, who was identified only as Jane; and his former assistant, identified in court only as Mia. During the trial, Mia testified that Combs sexually assaulted her, and Jane testified that the freak-offs continued well after Ventura had filed her suit and Combs’ properties had been raided by Homeland Security investigators. But it was R&B singer Ventura, who had an 11-year relationship with Combs, who providedsome of the trial’s most disturbing testimony. Douglas Wigdor, Ventura’s attorney, said his client “displayed unquestionable strength and brought attention to the realities of powerful men in our orbit and the misconduct that has persisted for decades without repercussion.” “We are pleased he has finally been held responsible for two federal crimes, something he has never faced in his life,” Wigdor said. In a letter to the judge on Wednesday, Wigdor wrote that Ventura believes Combs is “likely to pose a danger to the victims who testified” in the case, and asked that he remain jailed until his sentencing hearing. Mark Geragos, a former lawyer for Combs whose daughter Teny Geragos played a key role in his defense team, told The Times that “in any sane person’s view [the verdict] was a resounding victory and a complete prosecutorial rebuke.” Prosecutors charged Combs under theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as RICO, which requires that a defendant be part of an enterprise involved in at least two overt criminal acts out of 35 offenses listed by the government. Those offenses include murder, bribery and extortion. Though RICO cases are more typically associated with the mafia, street gangs or drug cartels, any loose association of two or more people is enough, legal experts say. Part of making that case in the Combs trial required proving the organization showed a pattern of criminal behavior, or predicate acts — such as bribery, kidnapping or prostitution — over a 10-year period. But RICO cases are difficult to prosecute by design, legal experts say. “RICO is a very rigid and difficult law to satisfy,” said Mitchell Epner, a former assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey who worked on numerous sex trafficking and involuntary servitude cases. “It requires an ongoing criminal structure, a continuity of members of a criminal organization. It is on purpose difficult for prosecutors to prove, and the defense did a very good job of pointing out the shortcomings of a RICO prosecution on a technical level.” With Combs case going to the jury, prosecutors presented weeks of graphic, stunning testimony. Was it enough? At trial, Ventura testified she felt “trapped” in a cycle of physical and sexual abuse by Combs, and that the relationship involved years of beatings, sexual blackmail and a rape. She claimed Combs threatened to leak videos of her sexual encounters with numerous male sex workers while drug-intoxicated and covered with baby oil as he watched and orchestrated the freak-offs. One such freak-off led to an infamous hotel beating that was captured on hotel security cameras. Video footage from that March 2016 night shows Combs punching and kicking Ventura as she cowers and tries to protect herself in front of an L.A. hotel elevator bank. He then drags her down the hall by her hooded sweatshirt toward their hotel room. A second angle from another camera captures Combs throwing a vase toward her. She suffered bruising to her eye, a swollen lip and a bruise that prosecutors showed was still visible during a movie premiere two days later, where she wore sunglasses and heavy makeup on the red carpet. In the trial, prosecutors said Combs and members of his group worked to cover up the incident. Eddie Garcia, a former InterContinental Hotel security guard, testified that Combs gave him a brown paper bag containing $100,000 in cash for the video. Ventura testified that the police visited her apartment. She answered a few of their questions, but told the jury she still wanted to protect Combs at the time. Combs’ defense team was aggressive in cross-examination, hammering witnesses about why they did not report the celebrity at the time or simply leave him. They presented text messages of support and love after the alleged attacks. The defense also focused on the money and material items the women got from Combs and pointed out that the government never indicted any other co-conspirators and didn’t call any of Combs’ inner circle to testify. Rahami, the former prosecutor, said the sex trafficking charges were weak because of the text messages, which were evidence of consent. “The prosecution’s only real chance of a victory was racketeering and to prove a non-sex-related predicate act like kidnapping, arson, extortion or bribery,” he said. “The fact that the jury even rejected that argument shows the many flaws in the prosecution’s case.” Still, Rahami said the government should have filed rape and kidnap charges against Combs, calling the decision not to “one of the many mistakes by the prosecution.” At its height, Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ Bad Boy Entertainment was a show business powerhouse, mixing music, video, fashion, liquor and style into a business that made Combs a billionaire. Was it really a criminal enterprise? When it came time for Combs’ defense team to present their case, they opted to move straight to closing arguments without presenting a witness. Marc Agnifilo, one of Combs’ lawyers, in closing told jurors that federal prosecutors “exaggerated” their case and sought to turn the hip-hop mogul’s swinger lifestyle into the most serious of federal offenses — racketeering and sex trafficking — without the evidence to back it up. In reality, Combs has a drug problem and his relationship with Ventura was a “modern love story” in which the mogul “owns the domestic violence” that was revealed in the trial, Agnifilo said. “This trial was a major gamble and Combs won that bet. Everything is stacked against the defendant going into a federal case, in particular one like this. His attorneys were smart and they owned the bad facts. They fought on the things that mattered and it paid off,” said Anna Cominsky, an associate professor of law and the director of the Criminal Defense Clinic at New York Law School. David Ring, an attorney who represents sexual abuse victims, said the government overreached in charging the case. “This is a win for Combs,” Ring said. “He was facing life in prison if convicted of the RICO charges. Instead, he likely serves a couple years in prison and returns to his business empire.” Still, Combs lost in the court of public opinion, the attorney added. “The irony of the verdict is that if Combs had simply settled Cassie Ventura’s lawsuit before she filed it, there would be no criminal case and Combs would still be a free man going about his business,” Ring said.

ABCNEWS,"After the verdict, a judge denied Combs bail. In asplit verdict, hip-hop mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs was found guilty of two of the five charges he faced but was acquitted of the most serious charge, racketeering conspiracy, capping a high-profile trial in Manhattan federal court. Combs was also acquitted of two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion – pertaining to former girlfriend Cassie Ventura and another former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym ""Jane."" However, the jury found Combs guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution – one each for Ventura and ""Jane."" Combs faces a maximumprison sentenceof 10 years for each of those counts. Following six weeks of testimony presided over by U.S. District Court Judge Arun Subramanian that saw the prosecution present34 witnessesand the defense present none, the jury of eight men and four women deliberated just over two days before reaching their verdicts. Tune into ABC at 10/9c Wednesday for an ABC News special, “Verdict: The Diddy Trial,” on the Sean “Diddy” Combs trial, and streaming next day on Hulu and Disney+. Several hours after the verdicts were read, the judge denied Combs bail, citing the violence that was ""starkly depicted"" in the 2016 hotel security footage that showed him physically assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. Subramanian called Combs’ domestic violence a ""propensity for violence."" ""It is impossible for the defendant to demonstrate… that he poses no danger to the community,"" the judge noted. Before the 5 p.m. bail hearing, Combs' attorneys pushed for his release Wednesday, arguing for a $1 million bond. “I am not saying it is not a serious crime,"" Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said of the prostitution counts Combs was convicted of. ""It is a crime of a vastly different nature,” he said. “I believe that a significant change in conditions is warranted.” Prosecutor Maurene Comey said the government plans to pursue “significant incarceration” for Combs on the prostitution charges. The judge set Combs' sentencing for Oct. 3 at 10 a.m. Earlier Wednesday, the verdicts sparked mixed reactions at the lower Manhattan courthouse and beyond. Combs got down from his chair and knelt on the floor after the verdicts were read, appearing to pray while some of his attorneys embraced. Marshals then escorted Combs out of the courtroom while some spectators in the gallery cheered and applauded. “Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution,” Douglas Wigdor, Ventura's attorney saidsaid in a statement. “By coming forward with her experience, Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry and the fight for justice,” the statement continued, in part. “We believe and support our client who showed exemplary courage throughout this trial. She displayed unquestionable strength and brought attention to the realities of powerful men in our orbit and the misconduct that has persisted for decades without repercussion.” “This case proved that change is long overdue, and we will continue to fight on behalf of survivors,"" the statement concluded. ""Sex crimes deeply scar victims, and the disturbing reality is that sex crimes are all too present in many aspects of our society,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted the case, said in a statement. ""Victims endure gut-wrenching physical and mental abuse, leading to lasting trauma. New Yorkers and all Americans want this scourge stopped and perpetrators brought to justice."" ""Prosecuting sex crimes requires brave victims to come forward and tell their harrowing stories. We and our law enforcement partners recognize the hardships victims endure and have prioritized a victim-centered approach to investigating and prosecuting these cases,"" the statement concluded. Combs wasinitially indictedin September 2024 on charges ofracketeering, sex trafficking by force and transportation to engage in prostitution. Asuperseding indictmentin March 2025 included additional allegations of forced labor under the racketeering conspiracy count, whileanother superseding indictmentthe following month added an additional charge of sex trafficking and one of transportation to engage in prostitution Federal prosecutors accused Combs of using his many businesses, and the people he employed to run them, to conduct a criminal enterprise to illegally coerce women into sex and conceal his alleged illicit conduct to protect his reputation. The alleged activities included ""sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice,"" according to the indictment. In addition to the racketeering charge, the indictment also included two separate counts each of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution, both involving two alleged victims. Combs' attorneys countered that Combs may well be a violent man – one who indulges in unconventional sexual conduct, abused illegal drugs and committed domestic violence – but he wasn't part of a broader criminal organization. “This case is about those real-life relationships, and the government is trying to turn those relationships into a racketeering case,” Combs’ attorney, Teny Geragos, told jurors in her opening statement. “The evidence is going to show you a very flawed individual, but it will not show you a racketeer, a sex trafficker, or somebody transporting for prostitution.” Theprosecution called 34 witnessesover six weeks of testimony, beginning with Combs' former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, whom Combs was seen physically assaulting in a widely circulatedhotel surveillance videofrom 2016. Other witnesses included two alleged Combs victims who testified under the pseudonyms ""Mia"" and ""Jane,"" as well as two male escorts to testified that they were paid to participate in so-called ""freak-off"" sexual encounters with Combs, Ventura and other alleged victims. The jury also heard from witnesses to alleged abuse and sexual acts, and a forensic psychologist who testified regarding why people often remain in abusive relationships. One of the most high-profile prosecution witnesses was Scott Mescudi, aka rapper Kid Cudi, who testified that he was told Combs allegedly broke into his home and had someone set his car on fire after learning that he was dating Cassie Ventura. Combs previously denied any involvement in the car fire. The defense, which twice during testimony unsuccessfully asked the judge to declare a mistrial, called no witnesses beforeresting their caseon June 24, just two hours after theprosecution rested theirs, electing only to read additional evidence into the court record. Combs told the court at that time that hedid not wish to take the stand in his own defense. Federal prosecutors the following daytold Judge Arun Subramanianthat they were no longer including attempted kidnapping and attempted arson as underlying crimes in the alleged racketeering conspiracy charge against Combs. Instead, prosecutors signaled that they would push sex trafficking and forced labor as primary predicate acts that the jury could find to convict Combs of racketeering conspiracy. Defense attorneys had argued that no evidence was presented directly tying Combs to the arson that damaged rapper Kid Cudi’s vehicle. Defense attorneys also argued that the alleged kidnapping of Combs’ former employee, Capricorn Clark, by Combs to confront Kid Cudi was far removed from the heart of the case. Federal prosecutors did not elaborate on their decision in their letter to the judge. The prosecution delivered a nearly five-hour-longclosing argumenton Thursday, June 26, summarizing 28 days of testimony and evidence. The defense spent four hours the next day presentingtheir summation, followed by the prosecution rebuttal. Deliberations began on Monday, June 30 after Judge Arun Subramanian gave the jury their instructions. On Tuesday, the jury told the court that they'd reached a verdict on four of the five five counts with which Combs was charged, they were unable to reach a verdict on the first count -- racketeering conspiracy -- prompting the judge to instruct them to continue deliberations.

ALJAZEERA,"The rap mogul was denied bail after he was found guilty on two prostitution-related charges but acquitted on others. Sean “Diddy” Combs has been found guilty on two federal counts of transporting people for prostitution. But at the verdict reading on Wednesday, he avoided convictions on steeper charges: two counts of sex trafficking and one of racketeering. The jury’s decision in the federalcriminal casebrought to an end nearly seven weeks of trial. The three acquittals mean that Combs — a musician and producer known for his work with artists like Notorious BIG — avoids 15-year mandatory minimum sentences for each of the more serious charges. The former billionaire could have faced life in prison if he had been convicted on sex trafficking or racketeering conspiracy. Wednesday’s verdict comes after the jury in the New York trial struggled to deliver a decision on all five charges a day earlier. After the verdict was announced, lawyers for Combs petitioned for the music mogul to be released on bail. But Judge Arun Subramanian denied bail on the basis that Combs had admitted to being violent towards past girlfriends. Combs, 55, pleaded not guilty to all five charges against him. Combs got his start scouting talent in the music industry — and eventually, he went on to found his own label, Bad Boy Records. With a successful rapping career of his own and other artists under his management, Combs became one of the most powerful players in the music industry. He was known for hosting high-profile parties, including some where attendees were required to wear all white. But prosecutors say he also held sex parties, sometimes called “freak-offs”, where women were forced into humiliating and abusive situations. Accusations from two of his former partners — singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura and a woman identified in court documents by the pseudonym Jane — were at the heart of Wednesday’s criminal case. Combs has also faced a slate of civil lawsuits alleging sexual abuse, including one with Ventura that resulted in a multimillion-dollar settlement. His lawyers have maintained that his sexual activity was consensual. These are the charges Combs faced and the verdicts for each: Wednesday’s verdict comes after the jury struggled to make a decision on all five criminal counts Combs faced. A day earlier, on Tuesday, the jury appeared poised to deliver a partial verdict. It had decided four of the five counts — but had stalled on a fifth. In the US criminal justice system, a partial verdict occurs when a jury reaches a unanimous decision on some but not all of the charges against a defendant. This typically happens in cases involving multiple counts in which the jury agrees on a verdict for certain charges but remains deadlocked on others. Partial verdicts help ensure that the judicial process is not delayed indefinitely owing to a lack of consensus on every count. In Combs’s case, the verdicts for the first four counts that the jury decided were not released on Tuesday. Instead, Judge Subramanian ordered the jury to continue deliberating, and decisions on all five counts were ultimately revealed on Wednesday. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge of racketeering conspiracy by Tuesday because there were “unpersuadable opinions on both sides”, it said. Racketeering carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Subramanian instructed the jury to continue deliberating on the racketeering conspiracy count on Wednesday. In addition to racketeering, Combs faced two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. A conviction for sex trafficking carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum sentence of life in prison. Transportation to engage in prostitution, which involves arranging to fly sex workers across state lines, carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. One of the highest-profile pieces of evidence was a surveillance video showing an act of violence between Ventura and Combs. First released by the news channel CNN, the video showed a March 2016 incident where Combs approaching Ventura in the hall of an InterContinental hotel, throwing her to the ground, kicking her and finally dragging her back to a room. Prosecutors said that, at the time of the incident, Ventura was trying to leave a “freak-off”, in which Combs would watch and masturbate to women having sex with paid male escorts. Combs’s behaviour, prosecutors argued, amounted to sex trafficking because the escorts were paid, and Combs used force and threats to coerce Ventura into participating in the “freak-offs”. They say Combs threatened to end her financial support or release sex tapes he filmed at the parties. On the Tuesday before the verdict, the jury asked to review Ventura’s testimony about the “freak-offs” and the 2016 hotel assault. “Jane” also said Combs forced her into drug-fuelled sex sessions with male sex workers. Racketeering, the charge against Combs on which the jury was undecided until Wednesday, involves a set of illegal activities in which an individual commits at least two related crimes within 10 years as part of a larger criminal enterprise. The law is designed to target not just isolated crimes but the broader structures behind them, such as gangs or corrupt businesses. Racketeering charges are used to dismantle criminal organisations by linking individuals to coordinated and systemic illegal conduct. Prosecutors alleged that for more than two decades, Combs led a criminal enterprise – abetted by his associates and employees – that worked to cover up a range of crimes, including sex trafficking, forced labour, drug distribution, bribery and obstruction of justice. To gain a conviction on the racketeering charge, prosecutors would have needed to prove that Combs established a criminal enterprise, or a coordinated plan between the musician and at least one other person. After the judge dismissed the jury and lawyers for both sides, Combs kneeled and appeared to pray. He then rose and addressed the courtroom gallery, saying: “I’m gonna be home soon. I love you. Thank you. I love you.” Combs’s family and supporters erupted into applause and cheers. The rapper chose not to testify during the trial. After the jury read the verdict, defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo asked the court to release Combs on bail. “This is his first conviction, and it’s a prostitution offence, and so he should be released on appropriate conditions,” Agnifilo said. But Judge Subramanian denied Combs bail, meaning the music mogul will remain in detention until his sentencing. Combs faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence on each of the two prostitution counts. Subramanian will determine Combs’s sentence at a later date."
