1,She's in jail and Diddy did pretty much the same thing and he's going to get away with it. Well I say give him the max on the charges he was found guilty of. If he gets 20 years that's pretty much life for him !
2,"oh, and diddy was not guilty as well. happy sunday."
3,If there was no list then why did Epstein SUPPOSEDLY kill himself and why is she still in jail? It‚Äôs all bullshit! Equally guilty on both sides! So much guilt that they‚Äôre now lying about it!! Epstein and Diddy sexually assaulting people and zero accountability! Disgusting. We
4,"Play ü§•, you guilty for knowing. Crying because you didn‚Äôt get your way. Freak like Diddy"
5,I don't know why they would be celebrating - rich f√º√ßkers don't go to jail but poor ones go nearly every time.
6,They keep switching from diddy to Epstein everytime one is in the public eye it‚Äôs hilarious everyone on this app is guilty af of baby killing
7,Tell us: 1. The Epstein and Diddy connections 2. The true story behind the Vegas shooting 3. The whereabouts of all the missing children 4. Who plotted to assassinate 5. Who‚Äôs actually guilty of treason 6. Who‚Äôs responsible for crimes against humanity
8,"AAH U R VERY TRICKY! U SENT THE FEDS AGAINST P. DIDDY SO HE COULD TAKE THE FALL 4 SEX-TRAFFICING BUT AS GOD SAID THE REPUBLICANS R THE SEX-TRAFFICERS OF 300,000 KIDS üßí PER YR WE SEE DIDDY NOT GUILTY OF THAT CRIME ALTHOUGH VIOLENT SO NOW EPSTEIN FILES üìÇ WILL DISAPPEAR"
9,Well.....they found Diddy not guilty. Really?
10,That‚Äôs a bullshit question. They need released and ANYONE on there should go to prison. Trump. Clinton. All of them. This is what is wrong with the world today- fuck the party - who cares if you have money (Diddy). Guilty is guilt. Not if you have money.
11,Diddy is not guilty and the Epstein Island was never visited by ‚Äúhigh profile‚Äù people.
12,Diddy not guilty so he doesn‚Äôt need to cry about his boo getting locked up.
13,And we didn‚Äôt really expect the corrupt U.S. judicial system to find P. Diddy guilty either ...
14,"...like if Diddy was found guilty, Trump would pardon him, cause that‚Äôs his friend and he went to those white parties. Trump has demonic friends."
15,"P- Diddy wasn't guilty of trafficking , he was just transporting üôÑ Epstein didn't have a client list and nobody committed pedophilia at his island. These people must really think the American people are stupid,"
16,Melly rotting in prison waiting for another trial while diddy and Epstein are found not guilty is just crazy
17,"To be fair, the trial would be in D.C. The only person who would be found guilty would be Trump, even with 0 evidence of any crime committed by him. The cases would be Diddy 2.0. Except Trump, that would be more like E. Jean Carroll 2.0"
18,If he releases the flight logs and client list from diddy and epstein than yes .. if not hes as guilty as they are of rape and trafficking of children for facilitating it
19,"Diddy's HUGE Legal Victory! üò≤ What Happened? I discuss Diddy's legal win! He was found not guilty of RICO and sex trafficking, a major victory. I delve into the implications of the verdict and what it means. DiddyCase pdiddy"
20,ITS TIME TO WAKE UP. Diddy not guilty No epstein list tik tok being censored isaac kappy WAKE
21,If Diddy could not be found guilty what makes us think this would have happened?
22,has Diddy been sentenced for his 2 guilty charges?
23,The whole P. Diddy trial was a sham[e] and our government knows it. Shame on them. P. Diddy is an evil dude....those who support him are just as guilty. nojusticenopeace karma accountabilitynow
24,"Literally, both Diddy &amp; Epstein were found ""Not Guilty"" in the same week... üòí"
25,Diddy was found Not Guilty too? Trump is a fucking moron and so is anyone working under his presidency
26,"Epstein, Diddy not guilty. No victims. No list. No penalties. It‚Äôs a big club and we are not in it. There were victims but no perpetrators. Makes total sense.."
27,"Sean Diddy Combs reportedly received a standing ovation from fellow inmates upon his return to a federal jail in Brooklyn after being acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering, according to his attorney. The hip-hop mogul, 55, was found guilty only on a lesser charge,"
28,WHAT'S NEXT FOR DIDDY? TheView co-hosts share their takeaways from the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial after he was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges last week and found guilty of two prostitution charges.

30,Diddy received standing ovation from fellow inmates after jury found rapper not guilty on RICO charge: lawyer FoxNews. Celebrating thug behavior.....pathetic!
31,"Preople people people, do you really believe this was going to turn out any differently than P. Diddy having his parties &amp; that rigged outcome. What makes you think only Jews are guilty of any of this jazz-Muzzz take 9yr olds, WTFFF¬©Ô∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
32,"Last week, Diddy was cleared of his sex trafficking and racketeering charges, yet found guilty on 2 prostitution counts‚Äì a verdict stirring conversation on power and accountability. What does justice look like when fame is in the mix? Click to read more:"
33,"I guess everybody on the list lawyered up, Maxwell in jail, Diddy suddenly not guilty, Giuffre passed away recently (no more voice), so nothing can be released. Might as well say a ""releasable"" Client List doesn't exist, they cited collapse of society as legal basis?"
34,"Yes he was, without any real evidence. Yet the people that found Trump guilty. Said Diddy was innocent with countless evidence. So really, can we admit the biased."
35,"This will be the down fall of the Administration &amp; the movement. 1. Informant Diddy's case dropped! 2. Epstein's disgusting nonsense thrown under the rug like nothing happened! 3. ' s , , are just as guilty as ppl on the Epstein list!"
36,And equally as stunned if they were expecting a guilty Diddy verdict. S A Mfers
37,What a bunch of BS. We all know that there is a very deep seeded list that IMO ties back to P. Diddy and that's why his charges are what they are now....it's all smoke and mirrors and both parties are guilty as fuck
38,"If they got rid of it, then that would‚Äôve been national headlines both parties are in on this. You can‚Äôt spend it anyway. This is the biggest scam along with Diddy being not guilty in so many of the charges"
39,"Hopefully the women (and male feminists) who are upset that Diddy basically got off, realize this happened in no small part because they pushed the ""me too"" crap. Diddy is a disgusting criminal and should have been found guilty. Part of the reason he wasn't is backlash to metoo"
40,"RP ‚Ä¢ A federal jury reached a mixed verdict in Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs‚Äô trial: ‚Ä¢ Not guilty of racketeering conspiracy (Count 1) ‚Ä¢ Not guilty of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion related to Ventura (Count 2) ‚Ä¢ Guilty of transporting Cassie Ventura...."
41,So Jeffery Epstein and Diddy are both ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù of trafficking? In the same week? something is fishy
42,First Diddy is found Not Guilty on all major Sex Trafficking Charges &amp; now the DOJ/FBI state there is no Epstein Client List. Decades of Child Abuse by Elite Perpetrators is being covered up &amp; buried in real time.
43,They do but for some reason people caught buying these services are never held accountable cough cough Robert Kraft. Like the diddy case I foresee a private trial leading to a predictable guilty verdict of lesser a crime. To keep the public quiet and forget about it
44,"Great time for Pedo‚Äôs and Corruption. Diddy not guilty, Epstein has no clients...ü§Æü§Æ Y‚Äôall disgust me bro!"

50,BREAKING: Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs returned to jail to a standing ovation from fellow inmates after being found not guilty of sex trafficking charges.
51,What is going on right now. Diddy not found guilty. Epstein had no client list. We are being played and lied. Wake up to reality

53,We already saw the movie.. Diddy not guilty... Epstein list - erased...
54,"the government and ""justice system"" do not exist to protect abuse victims. it exists to help abusers. diddy being found ""not guilty"" of his biggest crimes despite the evidence. and there suddenly being ""no epstein client list"" despite confessions of the opposite. it's sick."
55,Diddy received standing ovation from fellow inmates after jury found rapper not guilty on RICO charge: lawyer FoxNews Pretty much says it all. Shame on EVERY SINGLE JUROR!
56,Tell us: 1. The Epstein/Diddy lists 2. The REAL story of the Vegas shooting 3. Where are all the missing kids? 4. Who arranged to have killed? 5. Who's guilty of treason? 6. Who's guilty of crimes against humanity? Did I forget anything?

58,Neither does Trump but hey he‚Äôs the savior because he‚Äôs getting rid of the illegals right ? Even tho now under trump Diddy is not guilty and the Epstein list disappeared why? Because the dems and the republicans are on that list together ! That‚Äôs why neither party released it
59,Epstein was probably never guilty. You know just like P Diddy completely innocent.
60,If Diddy was a snitch he would‚Äôve been found guilty on all charges.
61,"After intense deliberations, the jury returned a partial verdict, finding Diddy not guilty on the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking ‚Äî but guilty on two counts related to transporting individuals for prostitution."
62,There is no point in doing arrests (although I think they were already done) until swamp cleaned and cleansing enema performed. If Diddy got off then swamp still there. Any arrests would be found not guilty and can‚Äôt re- try. Be patient.
63,ü•¥BREAKING: Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs returned to jail to a standing ovation from fellow inmates after being found not guilty of sex trafficking charges.
64,Diddy was being tried on his own. Epstein's accomplice was found guilty using the same victim testimonies that would be used in the Epstein trial. Do you understand logic?
65,So.. Diddy‚Äôs not guilty &amp; Epstein never had a client list. Interesting turn of events.
66,"Never said it did,but the FACTS are just what I stated. So since Obama has pictures with Diddy at parties, does that mean Obama is a pedo? If there was evidence of DJT guilty the Biden DOJ woulda threw his ass under the jail. You have no proof. Until then, it's conspiracy period"
67,Diddy received standing ovation from fellow inmates after jury found rapper not guilty on RICO charge: lawyer
68,don't forget in the last week Diddy was found not guilty too. There are people in powers bigger then those we see unfortunately and they don't want us knowing.
69,"Diddy said at one point in time that there are high-level politicians involved. Everyone in Trump's administration claims there is no list, just the same as Diddy was found not guilty. How much did all pay to cover up and lie? How much did Diddy pay the jurors Trump's hush money"
70,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs being found guilty on two counts in his sex trafficking trial, there have been some instances of people expressing support and cheering for him. Well ain‚Äôt that just idiocy in full force. I wonder how many of those malcontents would be cheering if their"

81,Im willing to bet black people will constantly remind each other that Diddy actually did that shit and shoulda been found guilty but will let Jeffrey Epstein fade into obscurity. Ill bet my life

91,"If the truth comes out, just like the sham Diddy trial, then everyone in Washington and Hollywood would be in prison. Both sides are guilty. Disgusting!"

94,Cassie is guilty of the same prostitution charges that Diddy commited. She literally arranged freak offs for her own enjoyment when Diddy was not even there. She gets $30 million. Diddy sits in jail.
95,"This should piss you off, 500k kids go missing in America every year and the DOJ just backtracked and said Jeffery Epstein didn‚Äôt have a client list a week after Diddy was found not guilty on every major sex crime he was charged with. Whoever set this up needs to go to prison."
