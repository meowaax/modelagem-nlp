1,She's in jail and Diddy did pretty much the same thing and he's going to get away with it. Well I say give him the max on the charges he was found guilty of. If he gets 20 years that's pretty much life for him !
2,"oh, and diddy was not guilty as well. happy sunday."
3,If there was no list then why did Epstein SUPPOSEDLY kill himself and why is she still in jail? It’s all bullshit! Equally guilty on both sides! So much guilt that they’re now lying about it!! Epstein and Diddy sexually assaulting people and zero accountability! Disgusting. We
4,"Play 🤥, you guilty for knowing. Crying because you didn’t get your way. Freak like Diddy"
5,I don't know why they would be celebrating - rich füçkers don't go to jail but poor ones go nearly every time.
6,They keep switching from diddy to Epstein everytime one is in the public eye it’s hilarious everyone on this app is guilty af of baby killing

9,Well.....they found Diddy not guilty. Really?
10,That’s a bullshit question. They need released and ANYONE on there should go to prison. Trump. Clinton. All of them. This is what is wrong with the world today- fuck the party - who cares if you have money (Diddy). Guilty is guilt. Not if you have money.
11,Diddy is not guilty and the Epstein Island was never visited by “high profile” people.
12,Diddy not guilty so he doesn’t need to cry about his boo getting locked up.
13,And we didn’t really expect the corrupt U.S. judicial system to find P. Diddy guilty either ...
14,"...like if Diddy was found guilty, Trump would pardon him, cause that’s his friend and he went to those white parties. Trump has demonic friends."
15,"P- Diddy wasn't guilty of trafficking , he was just transporting 🙄 Epstein didn't have a client list and nobody committed pedophilia at his island. These people must really think the American people are stupid,"
16,Melly rotting in prison waiting for another trial while diddy and Epstein are found not guilty is just crazy
17,"To be fair, the trial would be in D.C. The only person who would be found guilty would be Trump, even with 0 evidence of any crime committed by him. The cases would be Diddy 2.0. Except Trump, that would be more like E. Jean Carroll 2.0"
18,If he releases the flight logs and client list from diddy and epstein than yes .. if not hes as guilty as they are of rape and trafficking of children for facilitating it
19,"Diddy's HUGE Legal Victory! 😲 What Happened? I discuss Diddy's legal win! He was found not guilty of RICO and sex trafficking, a major victory. I delve into the implications of the verdict and what it means. DiddyCase pdiddy"
20,ITS TIME TO WAKE UP. Diddy not guilty No epstein list tik tok being censored isaac kappy WAKE
21,If Diddy could not be found guilty what makes us think this would have happened?
22,has Diddy been sentenced for his 2 guilty charges?
23,The whole P. Diddy trial was a sham[e] and our government knows it. Shame on them. P. Diddy is an evil dude....those who support him are just as guilty. nojusticenopeace karma accountabilitynow
24,"Literally, both Diddy &amp; Epstein were found ""Not Guilty"" in the same week... 😒"
25,Diddy was found Not Guilty too? Trump is a fucking moron and so is anyone working under his presidency
26,"Epstein, Diddy not guilty. No victims. No list. No penalties. It’s a big club and we are not in it. There were victims but no perpetrators. Makes total sense.."
27,"Sean Diddy Combs reportedly received a standing ovation from fellow inmates upon his return to a federal jail in Brooklyn after being acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering, according to his attorney. The hip-hop mogul, 55, was found guilty only on a lesser charge,"

31,"Preople people people, do you really believe this was going to turn out any differently than P. Diddy having his parties &amp; that rigged outcome. What makes you think only Jews are guilty of any of this jazz-Muzzz take 9yr olds, WTFFF©️🤦🏼‍♀️"
32,"Last week, Diddy was cleared of his sex trafficking and racketeering charges, yet found guilty on 2 prostitution counts– a verdict stirring conversation on power and accountability. What does justice look like when fame is in the mix? Click to read more:"
33,"I guess everybody on the list lawyered up, Maxwell in jail, Diddy suddenly not guilty, Giuffre passed away recently (no more voice), so nothing can be released. Might as well say a ""releasable"" Client List doesn't exist, they cited collapse of society as legal basis?"
34,"Yes he was, without any real evidence. Yet the people that found Trump guilty. Said Diddy was innocent with countless evidence. So really, can we admit the biased."
35,"This will be the down fall of the Administration &amp; the movement. 1. Informant Diddy's case dropped! 2. Epstein's disgusting nonsense thrown under the rug like nothing happened! 3. ' s , , are just as guilty as ppl on the Epstein list!"
36,And equally as stunned if they were expecting a guilty Diddy verdict. S A Mfers
37,What a bunch of BS. We all know that there is a very deep seeded list that IMO ties back to P. Diddy and that's why his charges are what they are now....it's all smoke and mirrors and both parties are guilty as fuck
38,"If they got rid of it, then that would’ve been national headlines both parties are in on this. You can’t spend it anyway. This is the biggest scam along with Diddy being not guilty in so many of the charges"
39,"Hopefully the women (and male feminists) who are upset that Diddy basically got off, realize this happened in no small part because they pushed the ""me too"" crap. Diddy is a disgusting criminal and should have been found guilty. Part of the reason he wasn't is backlash to metoo"

41,So Jeffery Epstein and Diddy are both “not guilty” of trafficking? In the same week? something is fishy
42,First Diddy is found Not Guilty on all major Sex Trafficking Charges &amp; now the DOJ/FBI state there is no Epstein Client List. Decades of Child Abuse by Elite Perpetrators is being covered up &amp; buried in real time.
43,They do but for some reason people caught buying these services are never held accountable cough cough Robert Kraft. Like the diddy case I foresee a private trial leading to a predictable guilty verdict of lesser a crime. To keep the public quiet and forget about it
44,"Great time for Pedo’s and Corruption. Diddy not guilty, Epstein has no clients...🤮🤮 Y’all disgust me bro!"

53,We already saw the movie.. Diddy not guilty... Epstein list - erased...
54,"the government and ""justice system"" do not exist to protect abuse victims. it exists to help abusers. diddy being found ""not guilty"" of his biggest crimes despite the evidence. and there suddenly being ""no epstein client list"" despite confessions of the opposite. it's sick."
55,Diddy received standing ovation from fellow inmates after jury found rapper not guilty on RICO charge: lawyer FoxNews Pretty much says it all. Shame on EVERY SINGLE JUROR!

58,Neither does Trump but hey he’s the savior because he’s getting rid of the illegals right ? Even tho now under trump Diddy is not guilty and the Epstein list disappeared why? Because the dems and the republicans are on that list together ! That’s why neither party released it

61,"After intense deliberations, the jury returned a partial verdict, finding Diddy not guilty on the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking — but guilty on two counts related to transporting individuals for prostitution."
62,There is no point in doing arrests (although I think they were already done) until swamp cleaned and cleansing enema performed. If Diddy got off then swamp still there. Any arrests would be found not guilty and can’t re- try. Be patient.
63,🥴BREAKING: Sean “Diddy” Combs returned to jail to a standing ovation from fellow inmates after being found not guilty of sex trafficking charges.
64,Diddy was being tried on his own. Epstein's accomplice was found guilty using the same victim testimonies that would be used in the Epstein trial. Do you understand logic?
65,So.. Diddy’s not guilty &amp; Epstein never had a client list. Interesting turn of events.
66,"Never said it did,but the FACTS are just what I stated. So since Obama has pictures with Diddy at parties, does that mean Obama is a pedo? If there was evidence of DJT guilty the Biden DOJ woulda threw his ass under the jail. You have no proof. Until then, it's conspiracy period"
67,Diddy received standing ovation from fellow inmates after jury found rapper not guilty on RICO charge: lawyer
68,don't forget in the last week Diddy was found not guilty too. There are people in powers bigger then those we see unfortunately and they don't want us knowing.
69,"Diddy said at one point in time that there are high-level politicians involved. Everyone in Trump's administration claims there is no list, just the same as Diddy was found not guilty. How much did all pay to cover up and lie? How much did Diddy pay the jurors Trump's hush money"
70,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs being found guilty on two counts in his sex trafficking trial, there have been some instances of people expressing support and cheering for him. Well ain’t that just idiocy in full force. I wonder how many of those malcontents would be cheering if their"

82,Diddy and Epstein not guilty in the same week. Tax dollars and true justice at work. What a fucking joke....
83,DIDDY NOT GUILTY EPSTEIN CLIENTS NOT GUILTY DISGUSTING

94,Cassie is guilty of the same prostitution charges that Diddy commited. She literally arranged freak offs for her own enjoyment when Diddy was not even there. She gets $30 million. Diddy sits in jail.
95,"This should piss you off, 500k kids go missing in America every year and the DOJ just backtracked and said Jeffery Epstein didn’t have a client list a week after Diddy was found not guilty on every major sex crime he was charged with. Whoever set this up needs to go to prison."
96,"""Not guilty"" doesn't equal = ""innocent"" and Diddy was convicted on the lesser charges and remains in Jail awaiting sentencing."
97,"diddy and epstein being found ""not guilty"" of trafficking in the same week is not suspicious at all 😃"
